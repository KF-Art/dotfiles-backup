				<p><p>Did you know that Void has over 20 mirrors?  We have mirrors all over
the world, but just having a bunch of servers isn’t enough to
effectively deliver package updates to all Void users.  A mirror that
is nearby can have extremely good performance if you know it’s there
and switch to it, but for many people what we would like to offer is
just a URL that works anywhere in the world to provide the best
download experience available in that location.  When you look at what
we’re trying to achieve, its pretty clear we’d be trying to build a
content delivery network (CDN) for Void.</p>

<p>Rather than re-inventing the wheel, we reached out to the team at
Fastly to see if they’d be interested in working with us to improve
the default package experience for Void users globally.  We’re excited
to announce that the answer is yes; Void has been accepted to the
Fastly <a href="https://www.fastly.com/fast-forward">Fast Forward</a> program.
As part of this project, we’ll be provisioning a new repo URL that
will retrieve packages via Fastly’s global CDN.</p>

<p>Stay tuned over the next few weeks for the new mirror to become live,
and a post about how Void’s mirror infrastructure works!</p>

				<p><p>Are you ready for Hacktoberfest 2022?  Void Linux is!  We’re excited
to be participating for our 6th year.  Contributions that help to
address our out-of-date packages queue are especially welcome.  This
is a great way to dip your feet into the world of Linux distro package
management and what happens behind the scenes to provide a wide
selection of packages and make sure your system remains up to date.</p>

<p>Updating packages is very easy.  You can select a package from the
list of <a href="http://repo-default.voidlinux.org/void-updates/void-updates.txt">out of date
packages</a>
and update it using the tools in the <a href="https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages">void-packages
repo</a>.  The
<a href="https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/Manual.md">manual</a>
might be of assistance when you are updating packages.</p>

<p>As a general rule, we recommend that newcomers to the Void Linux
project steer clear of “structural” packages unless you have specific
domain knowledge that qualifies you to work on high-risk packages.
When selecting a package to update, prefer packages registered to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">orphan@voidlinux.org</code>.  These packages are otherwise unmaintained,
and your contribution will have a bigger impact.  You can update
packages that have a maintainer assigned, but understand that
conflicting changes between a maintainer and contributor will be
resolved at the discretion of Void staff.</p>

<p>Here are some useful tips when updating packages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>While we’re not completely opposed to PRs that add new packages,
you’re much more likely to get your PR approved and merged if it’s
a well written update.</li>
  <li>Don’t PR broken code. Our maintainers are much less likely to give
a second look to a PR that didn’t build when it was submitted.</li>
  <li>While it’s possible to run xbps-src from an alien distro, this
isn’t really supported.  If you’re a seasoned Linux user and want
to try Void, now is the time!</li>
  <li>The update list is sometimes wrong. We’d love to get patches that
improve its reliability by <a href="https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/Manual.md#checking-for-new-upstream-releases">ignoring beta
versions</a>
or adding checks to packages that are not correctly detected as
out of date.</li>
  <li>If you have expertise in C, GNU Autotools, or other build systems,
taking a look at projects that we’ve marked as incompatible
with cross compilation and fixing the upstream issue can be
an amazing contribution that impacts more than just Void.</li>
</ul>

<p>Want to contribute but don’t know how to code?  No sweat!  We have a
documentation project that’s managed in git and can help you learn how
to use the tools of the trade without needing to simultaneously learn
how to manage our package build system.  Docs contributions should be
in the style of the manual, so make sure you <a href="https://docs.voidlinux.org/about/about-this-handbook.html">understand the
manual</a> and
feel free to open an issue or ask on IRC before starting on a larger
contribution to make sure your change can be accepted.</p>

<p>We look forward to working with the amazing world of open source
developers this month to improve Void and continue our high standards
for quality and reliability.  To ensure your PR has the best chance at
being accepted, feel free to reach out for help as explained in the
manual.  Together, we can make this a high-impact Hacktoberfest.</p>

<p>Today, we were informed that our long time contributor and maintainer Jürgen
Buchmüller (pullmoll) has passed away.</p>

<p>With boundless dedication, Jürgen was one of the most prolific contributors to
the Void project and sponsored the project financially, too.</p>

<p>He invested lots of his time in keeping GCC up to date and well tested, supplied tons of
patches to port packages to new compilers and platforms and also took care of
(co-)maintaining many packages, including several non-trivial ones, like OpenJDK
and LibreOffice.</p>

<p>He was not only a dedicated and driven developer in the Void Linux project, he
also was one of the friendliest and warmest people we had the pleasure to work
with. Jürgen will be missed as a steady force and a calm and wise voice in
discussions. Most of all, he will be remembered as a friend to all of us.</p>

<p>Our thoughts and condolences go out to Jürgen’s family, friends, and loved ones.</p>

<p><strong>Thank you, pullmoll.</strong></p>

		<title>Friday in the Void: OpenSSL and Kernel Hardening</title>
		<link href="https://voidlinux.org/news/2021/03/OpenSSL-hardening-updates.html"/>
		<id>https://voidlinux.org/news/2021/03/OpenSSL-hardening-updates</id>
		<published>2021-03-05T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-03-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="xhtml">
			<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
				<p><p>The previously announced <a href="https://voidlinux.org/news/2021/02/OpenSSL.html">OpenSSL switch</a>
is now underway. Because OpenSSL is a dependency of a large number of packages,
the full rebuild process is expected to take several days. Syncing between the
builders and public repositories has been suspended to ensure that the package
tree remains consistent. Consequently, no new package updates will appear until
the switch is complete.</p>

<p>Once updates appear, we recommend that you perform a complete system update to
simplify the transition. Partial updates are possible, but you will need to
manually trace all OpenSSL dependants installed on your system and update them
atomically.</p>

<hr />

<p>Since 2016, the default bootloader configuration in Void Linux has set
the Linux kernel command-line options <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slub_debug=P</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">page_poison=1</code> to
provide some level of kernel hardening. Kernel series 5.3 and later offer
alternative measures <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init_on_alloc</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init_on_free</code> (see <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/6471384af">this kernel
commit</a>).</p>

<p>Void’s kernels come with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init_on_alloc</code> option enabled by default where
available (<em>i.e.</em>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">linux5.4&gt;=5.4.102</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">linux5.10&gt;=5.10.20</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">linux5.11&gt;=5.11.3</code>). In most cases, you should not disable this option, as it
has a fairly minimal impact on performance (within 1%). The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init_on_free</code>
option is more expensive (around 5% on average) and needs to be enabled by hand
by passing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init_on_free=1</code> on the kernel command line. Similarly,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init_on_alloc</code> can be disabled if needed by passing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init_on_alloc=0</code>.</p>

<p>As a consequence of these changes, Void’s default kernel command-line now omits
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slub_debug</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">page_poison</code> options. There is a chance that your
existing system still has the old options enabled. They still work in newer
kernels, but have a performance impact more in line with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init_on_free=1</code>. On
older hardware this can be quite noticeable. If you are running a kernel series
older than 5.4, you can keep them (or add them) for extra security at the cost
of performance; otherwise, you should remove them.</p>

<hr />

<p>As always, if you experience any issues, feel free to reach out to us! You can
<a href="https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/issues/new">open an issue</a> on
GitHub or seek help in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#voidlinux</code> channel on <a href="https://freenode.net">https://freenode.net</a>.</p>

OpenSSL</a> on March 5th,
2021 (2021-03-05).</p>

<p>For most users, there should be no noticeable change. If you have any packages
installed that are no longer provided by Void, or your system has explicit

system continues to function after the switch.</p>

<hr />

<p>A discussion about switching to OpenSSL began in a Request For Comments (RFC)
posted on April 12th, 2020, at
<a href="https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/issues/20935">void-linux/void-packages#20935</a>.
Since then, a majority of Void maintainers have expressed support for the move.
The main reasons for the switch are as listed in the RFC:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Because most software targets OpenSSL, Void will no longer have to maintain
(in some cases, very complex) patches to support LibreSSL. The complexity of
the OpenSSL API makes such patching burdensome and risky, with mistakes
potentially causing runtime errors or security issues - we have avoided
those, as far as we know, but this has required a lot of effort.</li>
  <li>Extensive support for platform specific optimizations outside of x86.</li>
  <li>Access to new standards and algorithms earlier, such as full TLS 1.3 support.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result of the above, the switch to OpenSSL is expected to lessen the time
and effort spent on packages that require an OpenSSL-like library. This is
especially notable because most other distributions which used LibreSSL have
dropped it, so there aren’t as many people amongst whom to distribute the
effort.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alpine, which switched to LibreSSL temporarily, switched back to OpenSSL in
January 2019, with the <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.9.0-released.html">3.9.0
release</a>.</li>
  <li>More recently, Gentoo, which used to offer LibreSSL as an option, has
<a href="https://www.gentoo.org/support/news-items/2021-01-05-libressl-support-discontinued.html">discontinued that
support</a>
as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>For further context, LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/841664/">covered the subject of LibreSSL on
Linux</a> at the beginning of this year. The
article also covers the attention and improvements that the OpenSSL project has
received post-Heartbleed, which was one of the main reasons for Void’s initial
switch to LibreSSL.</p>

<p>For an example of extra work caused by packages that expect OpenSSL, Void’s
version of Qt5 is heavily patched in order to properly support LibreSSL.
Furthermore, the just released Qt6 would also need significant effort to be
patched and maintained to use LibreSSL, without the possibility of such effort
being upstreamed.</p>

<p>At the same time, other software can have limited functionality or hit edge
cases when using LibreSSL, due to not being thoroughly tested with it. One
example is Python, which is limited in the ciphers available to running
programs, since it depends on what the SSL library provides - they are even
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0644/#libressl-support">considering dropping any support for LibreSSL in the
future</a>. Another
example is OpenVPN, which we have received bug reports for connection issues
with LibreSSL
(<a href="https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/issues/23413">void-linux/void-packages#23413</a>).
This required us to switch the package to use Mbed TLS by default, resulting in
some limitations to the resulting package. With the switch to OpenSSL, the
OpenVPN package will now be provided in the most widely deployed and tested
configuration, so similar compatibility hiccups are unlikely to reappear.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this move has required us to drop some packages that rely on the
OpenSSL 1.0.1 API; while LibreSSL maintains compatibility with this legacy API,
modern OpenSSL has abandoned it.</p>

<p>One great feature of LibreSSL not offered by OpenSSL is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libtls</code> library,
which aims to be a hard to misuse interface for communicating over the web
safely, with sane defaults. Some of the packages we ship depend on it, so work
has been done to package a standalone version of it in
<a href="https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/28732">void-linux/void-packages#28732</a>.</p>

<p>The Void Linux team is grateful for the work of the OpenBSD community on
<a href="https://github.com/libressl-portable/portable">libressl-portable</a>, we have
greatly benefited from their work. Void continues to package other excellent
OpenBSD software, including OpenSSH and signify, which is our tool of choice
for signing live images.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we expect our switch to OpenSSL to ease maintenance overhead,
provide the same reliable experience to users, and improve functionality in
select packages. Look forward to the update landing some time after March 5th!</p>

		<title>Upcoming glibc upgrade requires updates for other packages on 32-bit machines</title>
		<link href="https://voidlinux.org/news/2021/01/glibc-2.32.html"/>
		<id>https://voidlinux.org/news/2021/01/glibc-2.32</id>
		<published>2021-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<content type="xhtml">
			<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
				<p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This only applies to users of Void’s glibc version on 32-bit
machines. If the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xbps-uhelper arch</code> prints something other than
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i686</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">armv7l</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">armv6l</code>, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">armv6l-musl</code>, you don’t need to do
anything.</p>

<p>Void Linux currently packages glibc version 2.30, but is going to update to
2.32 soon, together with the long awaited GCC 10. Since this new version makes
use of new system calls, due to the ongoing time64 (support for times after
2038 on 32-bit platforms) work on glibc, applications with restrictive seccomp
filters that haven’t been rebuilt for the new glibc version <strong>will stop
working</strong>. Packages with such issues include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openssh</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">firefox</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chromium</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">qt5-webengine</code> (and consequently dependants, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">qutebrowser</code>)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">electron*</code> (and consequently dependants, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">element-desktop</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be pushing updates to these packages <em>before</em> the glibc update, if
possible, but it won’t be possible for all of them. This includes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openssh</code>,
which means you can be <strong>locked out of your system</strong> if that’s what you use to
access it and you perform a partial upgrade that only includes the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">glibc</code>
package.</p>

<p>Therefore, even though Void enables partial upgrades, you should perform a full
system upgrade when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">glibc</code> appears in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xbps-install -Su</code> list. Be sure to
test these packages - for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openssh</code> this includes actually opening a session,
since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sshd</code> itself runs without issue. If for some reason something in your
system stops working, you can of course reinstall the old <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">glibc</code> package using
<a href="https://man.voidlinux.org/xtools.1">xdowngrade(1)</a> from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xtools</code> package:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># xdowngrade /var/cache/xbps/glibc-2.30_2.x86_64.xbps /var/cache/xbps/glibc-locales-2.30_2.x86_64.xbps
</code></pre></div></div>

			<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
				<p><p>Void Linux currently packages PAM version 1.3.0 and, until today, a standard
PAM configuration that requires the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pam_tally</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pam_lastlog</code>
authentication modules. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pam_tally</code> module was
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linux-pam/linux-pam/master/NEWS">deprecated in 1.4.0 and removed in 1.5.0</a>,
and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pam_lastlog</code> module is no longer built for musl systems. The Void team
plans to <a href="https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/25506">upgrade to PAM 1.5.1</a>
by the end of the year.</p>

<p>For the upgraded PAM to function properly, any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pam_tally</code> (and, for musl
users, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pam_lastlog</code>) requirements must be removed from the configuration files
in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/pam.d</code>. An updated <a href="https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/commit/e065ac229d78c4a1819098c7bda45bbd717120ba"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pam-base</code> package</a>
released today removes the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pam_tally</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pam_lastlog</code> requirements from the
standard configuration. If you have not modified the standard PAM
configuration and have not enabled the XBPS <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keepconf</code> option described in
<a href="https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps.d.5"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xbps.d(5)</code></a>, upgrading the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pam-base</code>
package should be sufficient to adjust your configuration.</p>

<p>Whether or not you have modified the PAM configuration, please make sure to
upgrade <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pam-base</code> and confirm that no configuration files in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/pam.d</code>
contain references to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pam_tally</code> module (and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pam_lastlog</code> on musl)
<strong>before</strong> upgrading to PAM 1.5.1 when it becomes available.</p>

to version 1.53.3 fixes
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-28924">CVE-2020-28924</a>.
From the <a href="https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-1-53-3-release/20569">release announcement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some passwords generated with rclone config may be insecure. In
particular if you used the ‘g’ generate option with rclone
v1.49 - v1.53.2 then your password will based on the second it was
generated in. This means that there are fixed number of passwords
in that period ~33 million.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We updated the rclone package to version 1.49.0, the first one affected,
on August 27, 2019. The upstream project recommends using their
<a href="https://github.com/rclone/passwordcheck">passwordcheck</a> utility to verify
that your passwords aren’t among the ~33 million vulnerable ones. On a
Void Linux system, you can obtain this utility by installing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go</code>
package and then building <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">passwordcheck</code> locally:</p>

				<p><p><em>Update:</em> Unfortunately due to recent changes that significantly
increase the effort required from Void, we can no longer promise that
your changes will count towards the 4 PRs required for Hacktoberfest.</p>

<p>Many maintainers use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git am</code> in a script to apply patches and batch
them into build units that the buildbot can work on at a time.  This
precludes the application of labels unless the maintainer separately
opens a browser, logs into GitHub, and interacts with the PR there.
While the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git am</code> method should technically work, we’ve noticed in
the past that GitHub occasionally applies the wrong status to PRs
using this method (ignores magic closing words).  We aren’t currently
aware why this works intermittently and we can’t guarantee that a
specific PR will satisfy the new requirements for Hacktoberfest.</p>

<p>It’s unfortunate that the rules were changed mid-run, as under the
previous rules we could process contributions without disruptive
alterations to our review process, and we could accept many first time
contributors’ work to low-risk packages.  You are of course still
welcome to send your patches and they will be reviewed at the
avaiability of the Void team.</p>

<hr />

<p>It’s the first day of October, the air is crisp in parts of the
northern hemisphere, and it’s time for
<a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> again.  This
year is shaping up to be bigger than previous years, and as Void has
participated since the start we’d like to provide some helpful tips
and tricks for sending your first Pull Requests (PRs) to Void.</p>

<p>This year Void is accepting patches for two main areas, patches from
unknown contributors beyond these areas have a high likelihood of
being dismissed, so please color within the lines.</p>

<p>The first area is for non-code contributions.  We maintain all of our
documentation using a tool called
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook">mdBook</a>.  This has the net
effect that all of our documentation is written as version controlled
markdown files.  If you regularly use Void and have been looking for a
place to get involved, this is a good point to jump in.  We aren’t
trying to recreate the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">ArchWiki</a> though,
so make sure you understand the scope and purpose of the docs repo
before sending your documentation.</p>

<p>For technical contributions, we are accepting updates of existing
packages.  While new packages may count as well, we have had many
problems in the past with people adding packages and then abandoning
them, so expect to meet significant resistance if you are a new
contributor trying to add a package to the repo.  Updating packages is
very easy.  You can select a package from the list of <a href="http://repo-default.voidlinux.org/void-updates/void-updates.txt">out of date
packages</a>
and update it using the tools in the <a href="https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages">void-packages
repo</a>.  The
<a href="https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/Manual.md">manual</a>
might be of assistance when you are updating packages.</p>

<p>As a general rule, we would prefer Hacktoberfest contributors that do
not have a previous track record with the Void Linux project steer
clear of “structural” packages unless you have specific domain
knowledge that qualifies you to work on high-risk packages.  When
selecting a package to update, select a package registered to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">orphan@voidlinux.org</code> when possible.  These packages are otherwise
unmaintained, and your contribution will have a bigger impact.  You
can update packages that are owned by existing developers, but
understand that conflicts between a maintainer and contributor will be
resolved at the discretion of Void staff.</p>

<p>Here are some useful tips when updating packages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t PR broken code, our maintainers are much less likely to give
a second look to a PR that didn’t build when it was submitted.</li>
  <li>While it’s possible to run xbps-src from an alien distro, this
isn’t really supported.  If you’re a seasonsed Linux user and want
to try Void, now is the time!</li>
  <li>The docs use <a href="https://github.com/bobertlo/vmd">versioned
markdown</a>, available in the
vmdfmt package.  You can run this locally to format your files.</li>
  <li>The update list is sometimes wrong, we’d love to get patches that
improve its reliability by ignoring beta versions or adding checks
to packages that are not detected as out of date correctly.</li>
  <li>If you have expertise in C, GNU Autotools, or other build systems,
taking a look at projects that we’ve marked as not
cross-compilation compatible and fixing the upstream issue can be
an amazing contribution that impacts more than just Void.</li>
</ul>

<p>We look forward to working with the amazing world of open source
developers this month to improve Void and continue our high standards
for quality and reliability.  To ensure your PR has the best chance at
being accepted, feel free to reach out for help as explained in the
manual.  Together this will be a high impact Hacktoberfest.</p>
